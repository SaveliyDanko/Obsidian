Defines how the background image will behave when scrolling the page.

```css
background-attachment: scroll;
```
The background image will scroll with the page. It will also position and resize itself according to the element it's applied to.

```css
background-attachment: fixed;
```
The background image will _not_ scroll with the page, and remain positioned according to the viewport. It will also position and resize itself according to the viewport. As a result, the background image will probably only be partially visible.
