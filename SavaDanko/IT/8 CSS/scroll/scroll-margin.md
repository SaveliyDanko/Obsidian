The `scroll-margin` property in CSS is used to add space between an element and the scroll container's edge when that element is scrolled into view, especially via functions like `scrollIntoView()` or when navigating to an anchor (`#id`).
```css
scroll-margin: <length>;
```

```css
scroll-margin-top: <length>;
scroll-margin-right: <length>;
scroll-margin-bottom: <length>;
scroll-margin-left: <length>;
```
