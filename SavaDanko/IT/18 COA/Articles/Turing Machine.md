Abstract computational device used to explore the limits of what can be computed.
- A Turing Machine consists of an infinite tape, a read/write head, and a set of rules that determine how it reads, writes, and moves on the tape.
- Despite its simplicity, a TM can simulate any real-world computation, making it as powerful as modern computers but with infinite memory.
