The members of an enum class E are all of the following:
- Members declared in the body of the declaration of E.

- Members inherited from `Enum``<`E`>`.

- For each enum constant `c` declared in the body of the declaration of E, E has an implicitly declared `public static final` field of type E that has the same name as `c`. The field has a variable initializer which instantiates E and passes any arguments of `c` to the constructor chosen for E. The field has the same annotations as `c` (if any).
    These fields are implicitly declared in the same order as the corresponding enum constants, before any `static` fields explicitly declared in the body of the declaration of E.
    An enum constant is said to be _created_ when the corresponding implicitly declared field is initialized.

- An implicitly declared method `public static E[] values()`, which returns an array containing the enum constants of E, in the same order as they appear in the body of the declaration of E.

- An implicitly declared method `public static E valueOf(String name)`, which returns the enum constant of E with the specified name.
