A method that is declared `static` is called a _class method_.

A class method is always invoked without reference to a particular object. The declaration of a class method introduces a static context, which limits the use of constructs that refer to the current object. Notably, the keywords `this` and `super` are prohibited in a static context, as are unqualified references to instance variables, instance methods, and type parameters of lexically enclosing declarations.

A method that is not declared `static` is called an _instance method_, and sometimes called a non-`static` method.

An instance method is always invoked with respect to an object, which becomes the current object to which the keywords `this` and `super` refer during execution of the method body.

References to an instance method from a static context or a nested class or interface are restricted.
