If a field is declared `static`, there exists exactly one incarnation of the field, no matter how many instances (possibly zero) of the class may eventually be created. A `static` field, sometimes called a _class variable_, is incarnated when the class is initialized.

A field that is not declared `static` is called an _instance variable_, and sometimes called a non-`static` field. Whenever a new instance of a class is created, a new variable associated with that instance is created for every instance variable declared in that class or any of its superclasses.

The declaration of a class variable introduces a static context, which limits the use of constructs that refer to the current object. Notably, the keywords `this` and `super` are prohibited in a static context, as are unqualified references to instance variables, instance methods, and type parameters of lexically enclosing declarations.

References to an instance variable from a static context or a nested class or interface are restricted.
