In addition to enum constants, the body of an enum declaration may contain constructor and member declarations as well as instance and static initializers.
```
EnumBodyDeclarations:
    ; {ClassBodyDeclaration}

ClassBodyDeclaration:
    ClassMemberDeclaration
    InstanceInitializer
    StaticInitializer
    ConstructorDeclaration

ClassMemberDeclaration:
    FieldDeclaration
    MethodDeclaration
    ClassDeclaration
    InterfaceDeclaration
    ;
```
Any constructor or member declarations in the body of an enum declaration apply to the enum class exactly as if they had been present in the body of a normal class declaration, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

It is a compile-time error if a constructor declaration in an enum declaration is `public` or `protected`.

It is a compile-time error if a constructor declaration in an enum declaration contains a superclass constructor invocation statement.

It is a compile-time error to refer to a `static` field of an enum class from a constructor, instance initializer, or instance variable initializer in the enum declaration of the class, unless the field is a constant variable.

In an enum declaration, a constructor declaration with no access modifiers is `private`.

In an enum declaration with no constructor declarations, a default constructor is implicitly declared. The default constructor is `private`, has no formal parameters, and has no `throws` clause.

It is a compile-time error if an enum declaration E has an `abstract` method `m` as a member, unless E has at least one enum constant and all of E's enum constants have class bodies that provide concrete implementations of `m`.
