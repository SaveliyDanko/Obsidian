A _member class_ is a class whose declaration is directly enclosed in the body of another class or interface declaration.
A _member interface_ is an interface whose declaration is directly enclosed in the body of another class or interface declaration.
A member class may be a normal class, an enum class, or a record class.
A member interface may be a normal interface or an annotation interface.

The accessibility of a member class or interface declaration in the body of a class declaration is specified by its access modifier, or by if lacking an access modifier.

If a class declares a member class or interface with a certain name, then the declaration of the member class or interface is said to _hide_ any and all accessible declarations of member classes and interfaces with the same name in superclasses and superinterfaces of the class.
