A class declaration may include _class modifiers_.
```
ClassModifier:
    (one of)
    Annotation public protected private
    abstract static final sealed non-sealed strictfp
```
The access modifier `public` pertains only to top level classes and member classes , not to local classes or anonymous classes.
The access modifiers `protected` and `private` pertain only to member classes.

The modifier `static` pertains only to member classes and local classes.

It is a compile-time error if the same keyword appears more than once as a modifier for a class declaration, , or if a class declaration has more than one of the access modifiers `public`, `protected`, and `private`.

It is a compile-time error if a class declaration has more than one of the modifiers `sealed`, `non-sealed`, and `final`.
