An _instance initializer_ declared in a class is executed when an instance of the class is created.
It is a compile-time error if an instance initializer cannot complete normally.
It is a compile-time error if a `return` statement appears anywhere within an instance initializer.
An instance initializer is permitted to refer to the current object using the keyword `this` or the keyword `super`, and to use any type variables in scope.
