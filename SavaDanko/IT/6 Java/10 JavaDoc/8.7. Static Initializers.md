A _static initializer_ declared in a class is executed when the class is initialized. Together with any field initializers for class variables, static initializers may be used to initialize the class variables of the class.
It is a compile-time error if a static initializer cannot complete normally.
It is a compile-time error if a `return` statement appears anywhere within a static initializer.

A static initializer introduces a static context, which limits the use of constructs that refer to the current object. Notably, the keywords `this` and `super` are prohibited in a static context, as are unqualified references to instance variables, instance methods, and type parameters of lexically enclosing declarations.
