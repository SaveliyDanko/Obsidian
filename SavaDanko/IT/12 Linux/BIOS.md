A basic input/output system or BIOS is a program fixed and embedded on a device’s microprocessor that helps to initialize hardware operations and manage the data flow to and from the operating system (OS) at the time of bootup.

The primary function of BIOS is to mediate between operating systems and the systems they operate on. The BIOS is the intermediate between the CPU and I/O device control information and data flow.

Initially, BIOS software was stored on the computer motherboard on a ROM chip. In modern systems, the BIOS is stored on flash memory, allowing it to be rebuilt without the need to remove the chips from the motherboard. This enables user-friendly BIOS firmware upgrades to introduce new features or rectify issues. Still, it also makes it possible for the machine to get contaminated with BIOS rootkits. In addition, a failed BIOS update might render the motherboard inoperable.

**ROM** — постоянная память, в которой хранится BIOS.
**POST (Power-On Self Test)** — процедура самопроверки железа.
**CMOS** — специальная энергонезависимая память, где BIOS хранит настройки (включая дату, порядок загрузки и др.).
